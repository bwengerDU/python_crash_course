# python_crash_course

 This project is to document my progress through the Python Crash Course book by Matthes. I will be uploading all of the exercises present throughout the chapters and the multiple large projects outlined in the book will be highlighted independently. 


## Project 1: Python Game
This project is aimed at the development of a python based game called, Alien Invasion. In this game the user will control a rocket ship located at the bottom of the screen. The ship's functionality will be to move left and right on the screen via directional buttons while shooting bullets via the 'Space Bar' towards aliens that will populate from the top of the screen. The player's goal is to shoot all of the initial aliens, which will then prompt a sebsequent wave of progressively faster aliens. If an alien hits the ship or makes it to the bottom of the screen the player will lose one of their three available space ships and the fleet will repopulate. If all three ships are lost the game ends. The imported sys tools are used to develop a module that will allow the player to quit the game as well. 

Python's Pygame package will be used as the primary mode for creating the game.

The game is initiated by mouse clicking on the play button, at which time the mouse cursor will disappear from the playing screen. Score is kept in the top right corner and with each subsequent level that is reached the aliens become quicker and the scoring is increased to reflect this increased difficulty. The current level tracked in the top right corner as well. In the top middle of the screen the game's top score is being tracked. In the top left the number of remaining player lives is tracked. The player will start with three and the game will end when they are out of lives.
