# python_crash_course

 This project is to document my progress through the Python Crash Course book by Matthes. I will be uploading all of the exercises present throughout the chapters and the multiple large projects outlined in the book will be highlighted independently. 


## Project 1: Python Game
This project is aimed at the development of a python based game called, Alien Invasion. In this game the user will control a rocket ship located at the bottom of the screen. The ship's functionality will be to move left and right on the screen while shooting bullets towards aliens that will populate from the top of the screen. The player's goal is to shoot all of the initial aliens, which will then prompt a second wave of faster aliens. If an alien hits the ship or makes it to the bottom of the screen the player will lose one of their three available space ships. If all three are lost the game ends. The imported sys tools are used to develop a module that will allow the player to quit the game as well. 

Python's Pygame package will be used as the primary mode for creating the game. 

## Project 2: Data Visualization
